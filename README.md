String Validation In python, Inspired by Validatorjs allows you to validate strings in a simple way. The functions names are the same as the ones in Validator.js
so you can easily switch between the two. 

## Installation

```bash
pip install <update_it>
```

## Why this project

This project is python port of [Validator.js](https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js) which is a library for string validation. So people who are familiar with Validator.js can easily switch to this library. 
It is also a good way to learn how to port a library from one language to another.
I have tried to keep the code as similar as possible to the original library.

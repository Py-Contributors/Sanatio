Introduction
============

This project is python port of Validator.js which is a library for string validation. 
So people who are familiar with Validator.js can easily switch to this library. 
It is also a good way to learn how to port a library from one language to another. 
I have tried to keep the code as similar as possible to the original library. 
if you find any bugs or have any suggestions please open an issue. 
if you want to contribute please open a pull request.

# Credit Card

On a credit card, a checksum is a single digit in the account number that allows a computer, or anyone familiar with the formula involved, to determine whether the number is valid. The checksum can help identify credit card numbers that have been entered incorrectly -- or phony credit card numbers created by counterfeiters.

## Foramt

The format of a credit card number is as follows:

1. First 6 digits: Issuer Identification Number (IIN)
2. Next 9 digits: Account Identification Number (AIN)
3. Last digit: Checksum
